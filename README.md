Contributions for the TARS system
This Repo is a collection of all the contributions that I have done for my Senior Design Class at Kennesaw State University. 
I was tasked with creating the Bin Detection system to notify the user of how full the bins were within the container.
I would also like to thank Joshua Olaniran and Kiano Watson for being excellent partners during this class and helping me along the way.
